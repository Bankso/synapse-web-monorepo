// We currently use Bootstrap 3 CSS but accidentally ended up using react-bootstrap 1.x.x, which was designed for Bootstrap 4
// In an effort to facilitate eventual migration towards Bootstrap 4, we backport certain styling that are new or changed in Bootstrap 4
// Any component with the class name "bootstrap-4-backport" will have bootstrap4 styles
.bootstrap-4-backport {
  @import 'node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
  //overrides/ utilities

  .dropdown-no-caret {

Configure and push a toast message using the settings below.

```jsx
<ToastDemo />
```

Note to developers: `displayToast` won't work unless you've created a SynapseToastContainer and placed it somewhere in your webpage. We don't configure one in this demo because the SynapseToastContainer has been configured for the entire Styleguide.

# Find Similar Components and Patterns

You are helping a developer discover existing components, hooks, and patterns in the Synapse web monorepo that they can reuse or reference as starting points for their implementation.

## Discovery Process

Search these key areas and **provide clickable file links** for everything you find:

### 1. Component Library Search

### 2. Component Analysis

For each relevant component found, note:

- **Props interface** (link to TypeScript definitions)
- **Hook dependencies** (link to custom hooks used)
- **Styling approach** (MUI components, styled-components, etc.)
- **Usage examples** (link to stories or other usage sites)

## Research Findings

Present your discoveries in this format:

### ðŸŽ¯ Direct Matches

Components that do exactly what's needed:

- **ComponentName** - Link to component file
  - Props interface and usage examples

### ðŸ“š Reference Patterns

Similar implementations to learn from:

- **Similar features** - Components with comparable functionality
- **Architectural patterns** - How similar problems are solved

## Helpful Search Terms

Use semantic search and grep for: "dialog", "modal", "form", "table", "button", "menu", "dropdown", "tooltip", "loading", "error", "validation", "fetch", "mutation"

## Key Principle

**Focus on discovery, not prescription.** Show the developer what exists and let them decide how to use it. Provide clickable file links for everything you reference so they can easily explore the code.
